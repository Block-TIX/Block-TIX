This is a placeholder for the hero-background.mp4 file.

For the actual implementation, you should replace the sample video with a high-quality video similar to what's used on the Token2049 Asia website (https://www.asia.token2049.com/).

The video should ideally:
1. Be in MP4 format
2. Have a resolution of at least 1920x1080
3. Feature blockchain/tech/event-related visuals
4. Be optimized for web (compressed to a reasonable file size)
5. Loop seamlessly
6. Be dark enough to allow text to be readable over it

The placeholder "Join the fun today!" text will appear at the bottom of the video.
